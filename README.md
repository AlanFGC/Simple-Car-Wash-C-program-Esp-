# Simple car wash administrator
A simple C program I created for my first fundies class.
This was one of the first programs I made, this was made before the Align program at Northeastern University.
When I discovered I really liked C language.
This program is supposed to be a car wash system that schedules new appoinments and creates/reads/edits/deletes users. 

Made in 2020.
